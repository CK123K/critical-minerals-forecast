 EV Sales & Lithium Production Forecasting for Green Energy Transition
This repository provides a data-driven forecasting model for global electric vehicle (EV) sales and lithium production, essential for the green energy transition and the critical minerals supply chain. The model applies scenario-based analysis to project future trends under High Growth (1.3x), Baseline (1.0x), and Low Growth (0.8x) scenarios.
Key Features
✔ Predicts global demand for lithium & EV sales 
✔ Scenario-based modeling for mineral supply & market demand
✔ Critical minerals forecasting for battery production & EV industry
✔ Automated validation of forecasting models
✔ Data processing & visualization for sustainability analytics
✔ Git-based version control for collaborative research

Why Critical Minerals Matter?
Lithium, nickel, and cobalt are essential for battery production in EVs.
Demand for critical minerals is rising due to the global shift to renewable energy.
Forecasting lithium supply & EV sales helps in sustainable energy planning.
Scenario-Based Forecasting
The model applies growth multipliers on historical data to estimate future EV market demand and lithium supply chain availability:

Baseline Growth: Final Forecast = Baseline Forecast × 1.0
High Growth: Final Forecast = Baseline Forecast × 1.3
Low Growth: Final Forecast = Baseline Forecast × 0.8
